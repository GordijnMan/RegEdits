# RegEdits
I used to run Windows as daily driver before getting more into Proton and Lutris. 
I remember hating how every version of Windows kept adding different menus to change the same settings. 
That's why I always preferred using Registry scripts.
Since I barely ever use Windows anymore, I figured I'd upload these old scripts.
Maybe it can help some of you who are still stuck using Windows for some reason.
